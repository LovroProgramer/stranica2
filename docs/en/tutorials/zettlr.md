# Zettlr workshop

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. It is [implemented in many applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Implementations), including Microsoft Teams, Discord, RStudio, Kanboard, and Discourse.

While any plain-text editor can be used to write Markdown, many students at [Faculty of Informatics and Digital Technologies](https://www.inf.uniri.hr/) like to use powerful integrated development environments such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). Unlike these developer-oriented tools, [Zettlr](https://zettlr.com/) is slim, fast, versatile, and user-friendly Markdown-specific editor that integrates well with reference managers such as [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/).

In the following, we will be relying on Zettlr's [official documentation](https://docs.zettlr.com/).
